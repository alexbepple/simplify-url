What is it good for?
====================

Some URLs on the net are overly long.

* <http://lifehacker.com/5926574> is just as good as <http://lifehacker.com/5926574/screenleap-for-gmail-offers-one+click-screen-sharing-from-your-inbox-or-google-contacts>.
* <http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0088CG2S6> is just as good as <http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0088CG2S6/ref=s9_newr_gw_d80_g340_ir03?pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=1XKGD5MM7W03Y4WTZPDE&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=463375173&pf_rd_i=301128>.

So if you do not want those monsters, e.g. as a service to the reader of your email or for your own sanity, this little tool for the Mac spares you from manually editing the URLs.


Installation
============

* Clone or download.
* Done.


Usage
=====

* Running `simplify.url.rb` simplifies the URL that is on the system clipboard. That's it.

The utility is destructive. If you have something on the clipboard that is not a URL, you probably will garble your clipboard. This does not bother me much right now. First, you run the utility yourself, so it's your responsibility. Second, if you are anxious about the contents of your clipboard, you probably should be using a clipboard manager anyway.

I use this as a script extension in [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). So my workflow looks as follows:

* copy URL
* run script from Alfred
* paste simple URL

It is the same workflow as with [Plain Clip](http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/plain-clip/).
